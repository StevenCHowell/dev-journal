# My Development Journal

A place for keeping notes of small helpful how-to's related to programming, data analysis, and related efforts.

This was inspired by Stav Shami's post [Three practices that will make you a more efficient programmer](https://medium.com/@shamir.stav_83310/three-practices-that-will-make-you-a-more-efficient-programmer-ebb2db776d2d).
